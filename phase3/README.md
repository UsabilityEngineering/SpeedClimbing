#### Task 1
Task one is a standard climber who frequents a gym and does not require equipment or staff assistance.
From this task we hope to answer questions such as: how quickly can a regular climber sign in? Is the experience
quick and painless? What can we improve for them?

#### Task 2
Task two is intended for a someone who is trying out climbing for the first time. This task will help us figure out
how the experience is for someone who is not only new to the interface but also climbing. 

#### Approach
We used a formative approach to our usability testing. We agreed on a prototype and have aimed to imprrove it. The easiest way to improve
our interface is to have users test it and watch and take notes on what they are doing and where they have the most issues. This will give us insight in to where users are getting stuck.
