The welcome page was designed to be as learnable and effective as possible with the main buttons featured prominently. According to our scenarios with certain personas who were new to climbing, it was originally hard to figure out what a newcomer would do. Accordingly, we tried to make it as apparent as possible. For our regular climber personas, we tried to make it simple for them to find themselves to check in by adding images next to the results and the option to type in either their name or ID. For staff, we made the orientation button fairly difficult to find so that no one else would accidentally press it as some of our personas were not too tech savvy and may be prone to accidents.
