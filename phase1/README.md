# Speed Climbing, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection
Michael Price, Ian McDonald

## Executive Summary
For this phase we completed
 - Naturalistic Observation
 - Analyzed Results
 - Brainstormed next steps

## Methods
# Naturalistic Observation
 - We used this method in order to determine where the main bottlenecks and frustrations of the current sign-in process reside
 - We observed a total of 9 people

## Findings

# Naturalistic Observation
 - For this method our users matched the demographics we were looking for as they were all first time or long time climbers at the Chico State Climbing Wall. 
 - We found that the slowest part of the process was waiting to get shoes. 
Similarly, they appeared the most frustrated waiting to get shoes

## Conclusions
 - We need to find a way to optimize getting shoes to users.
 - We need to speed up the time to introduce new climbers or have dedicated staff?
 - Make shoe sizing process more streamlined for user happiness

## Caveats
 - This was all mock data collected from our classmates during the COVID-19 outbreak. As such, it does not accurately match numbers we would get if we were to perform this study in the Chico State Climbing Wall at all. 

## Personas

# Name
 - Jane Jackson
# Work/School
-Sophomore at Chico State.
-Working on her mechanical engineering degree
# Demographics
-19 years old
-Large friend group
-Works out with friends
-Has never climbed
# Goals/Tasks
 - Curious about the Chico State campus. Has some free time between classes.
# Abilities
 - Proficient in most computer technologies. Decent typing speed. Must spend a lot of time on the internet for classes.

# Name
 - Jeff Jacobson
# Work/School
-Super Senior at Chico State.
-Working on his electrical engineering degree
-Works at Adventure Outings
# Demographics
-24 years old
-Climbs 3-4 times a week
-Friends with climbers at school
# Goals/Tasks
 - Taking a lot of easy classes along with his senior project. Has a lot of free time. 
# Abilities
 - Not great with computers. Uses one finger to type numbers. Doesn’t use the numpad. Spends most of his free time finding new outdoor climbing areas.


## Scenarios
 - Jane Jackson and her friends have been working out after their last class of the day. It’s the weekend so they have a lot of time on their hands. They have been curious about the Climbing Wall and have finally decided to go check it out. It’s their first time and they are fairly nervous to go in. 

 - Jeff Jacobson just got out of class and his next one doesn’t start for another four hours. It was a pretty stressful class so he decided to go to the Climbing Wall in between classes and hang out with some of his friends in there. He doesn’t have much time and wants to get the check-in process done as quickly as possible.

## Supplementary Materials
 - We would have collected notes on paper for the timing information in the naturalistic observation. 



## Methods

Describe (A) Methods you used (B) Why you used them, and (C) Number of users (e.g. n=10) for each method

## Findings

For each method, describe the users you collected data from (demographics and how they represent your user base) and summarize the findings point-by-point (for example, the distribution of answers for a multiple-choice question). If you are researching existing software and/or competitor software, you may want to include pictures with call-outs that point out both important features and flaws within the interface.

## Conclusions

Discoveries derived from the method(s). For example, explain a requirement (e.g. “Task X needs to be accomplished with fewer steps. . . ”) based on a finding (e.g. “. . . because in our contextual inquiry, we found it was what the users did most often and complained about extraneous work needed to complete it”)

## Caveats

Considerations and/or limitations to the method(s) you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc.

## Personas

Provide each of your user personas, which represent (potential) users of your software; explain how you derived these personas from your user inquiry

## Scenarios

Identify the primary scenarios for your software and for each, include a description that explains who (of your personas) and what they want to do

## Supplementary Materials

Include link(s) or cop(ies) to your instrument(s) itself (questionnaire for a survey, protocol for an interview or contextual inquiry, etc)
