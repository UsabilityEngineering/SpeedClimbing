# Speed Climbing, Phase 1: User Inquiry and Inspection
Michael Price, Ian McDonald

## Executive Summary
For this phase we completed
 - Naturalistic Observation
 - Analyzed Results
 - Brainstormed next steps

## Methods
### Naturalistic Observation
 - We used this method in order to determine where the main bottlenecks and frustrations of the current sign-in process reside
 - We observed a total of 9 people

## Findings

### Naturalistic Observation
 - For this method our users matched the demographics we were looking for as they were all first time or long time climbers at the Chico State Climbing Wall. 
 - We found that the slowest part of the process was waiting to get shoes. 
 - Similarly, they appeared the most frustrated waiting to get shoes

## Conclusions
 - We need to find a way to optimize getting shoes to users.
 - We need to speed up the time to introduce new climbers or have dedicated staff?
 - Make shoe sizing process more streamlined for user happiness

## Caveats
 - This was all mock data collected from our classmates during the COVID-19 outbreak. As such, it does not accurately match numbers we would get if we were to perform this study in the Chico State Climbing Wall at all. 

## Personas
### Persona 1:
#### Name:
 - Jane Jackson
#### Work/School:
 - Sophomore at Chico State.
 - Working on her mechanical engineering degree
#### Demographics:
 - 19 years old
 - Large friend group
 - Works out with friends
 - Has never climbed
#### Goals/Tasks:
 - Curious about the Chico State campus. Has some free time between classes.
#### Abilities:
 - Proficient in most computer technologies. Decent typing speed. Must spend a lot of time on the internet for classes.

### Persona 2:
#### Name:
 - Jeff Jacobson
#### Work/School:
 - Super Senior at Chico State.
 - Working on his electrical engineering degree
 - Works at Adventure Outings
#### Demographics:
 - 24 years old
 - Climbs 3-4 times a week
 - Friends with climbers at school
#### Goals/Tasks:
 - Taking a lot of easy classes along with his senior project. Has a lot of free time. 
#### Abilities:
 - Not great with computers. Uses one finger to type numbers. Doesn’t use the numpad. Spends most of his free time finding new outdoor climbing areas.

## Scenarios
 - Jane Jackson and her friends have been working out after their last class of the day. It’s the weekend so they have a lot of time on their hands. They have been curious about the Climbing Wall and have finally decided to go check it out. It’s their first time and they are fairly nervous to go in. 

 - Jeff Jacobson just got out of class and his next one doesn’t start for another four hours. It was a pretty stressful class so he decided to go to the Climbing Wall in between classes and hang out with some of his friends in there. He doesn’t have much time and wants to get the check-in process done as quickly as possible.

## Supplementary Materials
 - We would have collected notes on paper for the timing information in the naturalistic observation.
